   A nice delicious crunchy snack, creamy on the inside with smokey bite. A bacon grilled cheese is acceptable at any time of the day, and in any situation. A perfect side to this dish is one of your favorit soups.

    Ingrediants
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  <ul>
    <li>8 strips thick-cut maple-glazed bacon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed</li>
    <li>8 slices sourdough bread</li>
    <li>12 ounces cotswold cheese (double Gloucester with chives) or cheddar, shredded</li>

    Steps
  </h2>
  <hr/>
<ol>
  <li>Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Wipe out the skillet.</li>
  
  <li>Heat the butter in the skillet over medium heat. Add 2 bread slices. Top each with one-quarter of the cheese and 2 strips bacon. Spread 2 bread slices with some of the dressing and press them on top of the sandwiches, dressing-side down.</li>
  
  <li>Cook until the cheese melts and the bread is golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat to make 2 more sandwiches, adding more butter as needed.</li>
